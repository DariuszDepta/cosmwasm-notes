# Wasmer in CosmWasm


## Asked ChatGPT 

**Question:**

In what extent is Wasmer Singlepass compiler different from Cranelift and LLVM solutions
used internally in Wasmerio Edge offering?

**Answer:**

Good question — Wasmer uses different backends (compilers) to turn WebAssembly (Wasm)
into native machine code, and each has different trade-offs.
Here’s a breakdown of Singlepass vs. Cranelift vs. LLVM in the context of Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:

### Wasmer Singlepass

- **Design goal**: Predictable, safe execution with extremely fast compilation speed.
- **How it works**: `Singlepass` means it goes through the Wasm bytecode once, generating machine code without deep optimizations.
  Each Wasm instruction maps pretty directly to a sequence of native instructions.
- **Pros**:
  - Very low compilation latency → ideal for short-lived functions (e.g. serverless cold starts).
  - Deterministic stack spilling → strong guarantees around memory safety and security.
  - Lower memory usage compared to Cranelift/LLVM.

Cons:

Slower runtime execution (code runs ~2–3× slower than Cranelift or LLVM).

Very limited optimizations.

Best for:

Fast startup / untrusted sandbox environments (IoT, blockchain smart contracts, edge cases with tight resource constraints).

2. Cranelift

Design goal: Balance between compilation speed and execution performance.

How it works:

JIT compiler designed specifically for WebAssembly (now part of the Bytecode Alliance).

Generates relatively optimized code, but compiles faster than LLVM.

Pros:

Much faster runtime than Singlepass (optimized register allocation, inlining, some vectorization).

Still relatively fast to compile, though slower than Singlepass.

Cons:

Not as fast or optimized as LLVM for long-running workloads.

Best for:

Serverless and edge workloads where you want better performance than Singlepass but still reasonable startup time.

3. LLVM

Design goal: Maximum runtime performance with deep optimizations.

How it works:

Uses LLVM as a backend, applying advanced compiler passes (vectorization, loop unrolling, interprocedural analysis, etc.).

Pros:

Fastest runtime execution (often close to native C performance).

Huge ecosystem of optimizations.

Cons:

Slowest compilation time (can be 10–50× slower than Singlepass).

Higher memory usage.

Best for:

Long-lived services and compute-heavy workloads where compilation overhead is amortized.

In Wasmer Edge (Wasmer’s managed compute platform):

Singlepass: used when you need near-instant cold starts and strict safety.

Cranelift: good middle ground, default in many cases.

LLVM: reserved for workloads where execution speed matters much more than startup latency.

✅ Summary:

Singlepass = fastest to compile, slowest to run.

Cranelift = balanced (good trade-off).

LLVM = slowest to compile, fastest to run.


Assuming I compile WASM using Wasmer LLVM, is it possible to store the compiled code somewhere outside the memory? Can you find any working example if so?
ChatGPT powiedział:

Absolutely—yes, when using Wasmer with the LLVM compiler, it is possible to persist the compiled WebAssembly code outside of in-memory execution. The mechanism varies by language, but the functionality exists across Wasmer’s supported platforms. Below are working examples and details to guide you:

Go Example (wasmer-go)

With wasmer-go, you can compile a module, serialize it to bytes, and save it to disk—even when using LLVM:

config := wasmer.NewConfig().UseLLVMCompiler().UseNativeEngine()
engine := wasmer.NewEngineWithConfig(config)
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// Serialize the module (includes compiled code)
serialized, _ := module.Serialize()

// Persist to disk
ioutil.WriteFile("module_cache.bin", serialized, 0644)

// Later, reload it
data, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("module_cache.bin")
module2, _ := wasmer.DeserializeModule(store, data)
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module2, wasmer.NewImportObject())


The important pieces:

.UseLLVMCompiler() ensures the LLVM backend.

.UseNativeEngine() enables the Native engine, which stores compiled code in a shared library format (.so, .dll, .dylib).

Serialize() captures the compiled code, and DeserializeModule() allows reloading it later 
Wasmer
.

Rust Example (wasmer-rust)

In Rust, Wasmer supports AOT and serialized artifacts too:

use wasmer::{Store, Module};

let mut store = Store::default();
let module = Module::new(&store, wasm_bytes)?;
// Optionally, configure the engine to use LLVM if needed.

// Serialize compiled module to bytes
let serialized: Vec<u8> = module.serialize()?;

// Save `serialized` to a file, later load using:
let loaded_module = unsafe { Module::deserialize(&store, &serialized)? };
// Instantiate as usual


Here:

Module::new compiles the module (using whichever backend is configured—LLVM if set).

serialize() captures the compiled output.

deserialize() reloads it, enabling reuse without recompilation

Additional Context: Caching Strategies

Beyond simple serialization, more advanced caching techniques exist:

In HPC contexts, tools built on Wasmer store LLVM-generated shared objects on disk, keyed by a hash of the original Wasm module. This ensures that recompilation only happens if the module changes

In Wasmer versions 4.2 and above, zero-copy deserialization dramatically speeds up module loading: load times can be cut by nearly half with this method

Summary Table
Feature	Supported?	How to Use It
Persist LLVM-compiled code	Yes	Use Native engine + Serialize() / DeserializeModule() in Go; serialize() / deserialize() in Rust
Store compiled code on disk	Yes	Write serialized bytes to file
Zero-copy deserialization	Yes	Automatic in Wasmer 4.2+ for faster load times
Shared-object caching	Yes (advanced)	Use hash-based filesystem storage in specialized setups
Final Thoughts

Yes, you can store compiled Wasm modules (even those compiled via LLVM) outside memory, for reuse across executions.

Working examples:

Go: Use .UseLLVMCompiler() + .UseNativeEngine() and serialize to and from disk 
Wasmer
.

Rust: Call serialize() and deserialize() on Module, with the appropriate compiler configured 
wasmerio.github.io
.

Advanced performance:

Zero-copy deserialization in Wasmer 4.2+ can improve load times significantly

Filesystem caching based on hash and shared-object artifacts is used effectively in HPC and edge scenarios

Is it the same possible using wasmtime?
ChatGPT powiedział:

Great follow-up 👌 — Wasmtime (like Wasmer) also lets you persist compiled Wasm code outside of memory and reload it later, but the mechanism is a bit different.

🔑 Key difference vs Wasmer

In Wasmer, you call serialize() / deserialize() on a Module and optionally use the Native engine to emit .so/.dll/.dylib.

In Wasmtime, you use the Module::serialize / Module::deserialize API.

Wasmtime serializes the compiled code into a binary blob (engine-independent format).

You can then save this blob to disk and later load it back without recompiling the original Wasm.

🦀 Rust Example (Wasmtime)
use wasmtime::{Engine, Module};

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Use default engine (Cranelift by default; can configure LLVM)
    let engine = Engine::default();

    // Compile module
    let wasm = std::fs::read("example.wasm")?;
    let module = Module::new(&engine, &wasm)?;

    // Serialize compiled module to bytes
    let serialized = module.serialize()?;
    std::fs::write("cached_module.cwasm", serialized)?;

    // Later: reload without recompilation
    let data = std::fs::read("cached_module.cwasm")?;
    let module2 = unsafe { Module::deserialize(&engine, &data)? };

    println!("Reloaded module successfully");
    Ok(())
}

⚙️ Configuring Compiler Backend

By default, Wasmtime uses Cranelift.
But you can enable LLVM if you compile Wasmtime with the wasmtime-llvm feature enabled. Then the above serialization works the same way — the compiled code (LLVM-generated) is stored in the serialized blob.

✅ Summary

Yes, Wasmtime also supports persisting compiled Wasm outside memory.

API: Module::serialize() → write to disk → Module::deserialize() later.

Works with both Cranelift and LLVM backends (depending on how Wasmtime is built).

The format is portable across runs of the same engine, but not guaranteed to be portable across different Wasmtime versions.

👉 Do you want me to show you a working minimal example where the same .cwasm file is generated once, and then loaded multiple times without recompilation (with timing benchmarks)? That way you can see how much startup time it saves compared to recompiling.
