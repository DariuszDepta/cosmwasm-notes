# Wasmer in CosmWasm


## Asked ChatGPT 

**Question:**

In what extent is Wasmer Singlepass compiler different from Cranelift and LLVM solutions
used internally in Wasmerio Edge offering?

**Answer:**

Good question — Wasmer uses different backends (compilers) to turn WebAssembly (Wasm)
into native machine code, and each has different trade-offs.
Here’s a breakdown of Singlepass vs. Cranelift vs. LLVM in the context of Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:

### Wasmer Singlepass

- **Design goal**: Predictable, safe execution with extremely fast compilation speed.
- **How it works**: `Singlepass` means it goes through the Wasm bytecode once, generating machine code without deep optimizations.
  Each Wasm instruction maps pretty directly to a sequence of native instructions.
- **Pros**:
  - Very low compilation latency → ideal for short-lived functions (e.g. serverless cold starts).
  - Deterministic stack spilling → strong guarantees around memory safety and security.
  - Lower memory usage compared to Cranelift/LLVM.

Cons:

Slower runtime execution (code runs ~2–3× slower than Cranelift or LLVM).

Very limited optimizations.

Best for:

Fast startup / untrusted sandbox environments (IoT, blockchain smart contracts, edge cases with tight resource constraints).

2. Cranelift

Design goal: Balance between compilation speed and execution performance.

How it works:

JIT compiler designed specifically for WebAssembly (now part of the Bytecode Alliance).

Generates relatively optimized code, but compiles faster than LLVM.

Pros:

Much faster runtime than Singlepass (optimized register allocation, inlining, some vectorization).

Still relatively fast to compile, though slower than Singlepass.

Cons:

Not as fast or optimized as LLVM for long-running workloads.

Best for:

Serverless and edge workloads where you want better performance than Singlepass but still reasonable startup time.

3. LLVM

Design goal: Maximum runtime performance with deep optimizations.

How it works:

Uses LLVM as a backend, applying advanced compiler passes (vectorization, loop unrolling, interprocedural analysis, etc.).

Pros:

Fastest runtime execution (often close to native C performance).

Huge ecosystem of optimizations.

Cons:

Slowest compilation time (can be 10–50× slower than Singlepass).

Higher memory usage.

Best for:

Long-lived services and compute-heavy workloads where compilation overhead is amortized.

In Wasmer Edge (Wasmer’s managed compute platform):

Singlepass: used when you need near-instant cold starts and strict safety.

Cranelift: good middle ground, default in many cases.

LLVM: reserved for workloads where execution speed matters much more than startup latency.

✅ Summary:

Singlepass = fastest to compile, slowest to run.

Cranelift = balanced (good trade-off).

LLVM = slowest to compile, fastest to run.


Assuming I compile WASM using Wasmer LLVM, is it possible to store the compiled code somewhere outside the memory? Can you find any working example if so?
ChatGPT powiedział:

Absolutely—yes, when using Wasmer with the LLVM compiler, it is possible to persist the compiled WebAssembly code outside of in-memory execution. The mechanism varies by language, but the functionality exists across Wasmer’s supported platforms. Below are working examples and details to guide you:

Go Example (wasmer-go)

With wasmer-go, you can compile a module, serialize it to bytes, and save it to disk—even when using LLVM:

config := wasmer.NewConfig().UseLLVMCompiler().UseNativeEngine()
engine := wasmer.NewEngineWithConfig(config)
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// Serialize the module (includes compiled code)
serialized, _ := module.Serialize()

// Persist to disk
ioutil.WriteFile("module_cache.bin", serialized, 0644)

// Later, reload it
data, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("module_cache.bin")
module2, _ := wasmer.DeserializeModule(store, data)
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module2, wasmer.NewImportObject())


The important pieces:

.UseLLVMCompiler() ensures the LLVM backend.

.UseNativeEngine() enables the Native engine, which stores compiled code in a shared library format (.so, .dll, .dylib).

Serialize() captures the compiled code, and DeserializeModule() allows reloading it later 
Wasmer
.

Rust Example (wasmer-rust)

In Rust, Wasmer supports AOT and serialized artifacts too:

use wasmer::{Store, Module};

let mut store = Store::default();
let module = Module::new(&store, wasm_bytes)?;
// Optionally, configure the engine to use LLVM if needed.

// Serialize compiled module to bytes
let serialized: Vec<u8> = module.serialize()?;

// Save `serialized` to a file, later load using:
let loaded_module = unsafe { Module::deserialize(&store, &serialized)? };
// Instantiate as usual


Here:

Module::new compiles the module (using whichever backend is configured—LLVM if set).

serialize() captures the compiled output.

deserialize() reloads it, enabling reuse without recompilation

Additional Context: Caching Strategies

Beyond simple serialization, more advanced caching techniques exist:

In HPC contexts, tools built on Wasmer store LLVM-generated shared objects on disk, keyed by a hash of the original Wasm module. This ensures that recompilation only happens if the module changes

In Wasmer versions 4.2 and above, zero-copy deserialization dramatically speeds up module loading: load times can be cut by nearly half with this method

Summary Table
Feature	Supported?	How to Use It
Persist LLVM-compiled code	Yes	Use Native engine + Serialize() / DeserializeModule() in Go; serialize() / deserialize() in Rust
Store compiled code on disk	Yes	Write serialized bytes to file
Zero-copy deserialization	Yes	Automatic in Wasmer 4.2+ for faster load times
Shared-object caching	Yes (advanced)	Use hash-based filesystem storage in specialized setups
Final Thoughts

Yes, you can store compiled Wasm modules (even those compiled via LLVM) outside memory, for reuse across executions.

Working examples:

Go: Use .UseLLVMCompiler() + .UseNativeEngine() and serialize to and from disk 
Wasmer
.

Rust: Call serialize() and deserialize() on Module, with the appropriate compiler configured

Advanced performance:

Zero-copy deserialization in Wasmer 4.2+ can improve load times significantly

Filesystem caching based on hash and shared-object artifacts is used effectively in HPC and edge scenarios
