# Wasmer in CosmWasm


## Asked ChatGPT 

**Question:**

In what extent is Wasmer Singlepass compiler different from Cranelift and LLVM solutions
used internally in Wasmerio Edge offering?

**Answer:**

Good question — Wasmer uses different backends (compilers) to turn WebAssembly (Wasm)
into native machine code, and each has different trade-offs.
Here’s a breakdown of Singlepass vs. Cranelift vs. LLVM in the context of Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:

### Wasmer Singlepass

- **Design goal**: Predictable, safe execution with extremely fast compilation speed.
- **How it works**: `Singlepass` means it goes through the Wasm bytecode once, generating machine code without deep optimizations.
  Each Wasm instruction maps pretty directly to a sequence of native instructions.
- **Pros**:
  - Very low compilation latency → ideal for short-lived functions (e.g. serverless cold starts).
  - Deterministic stack spilling → strong guarantees around memory safety and security.
  - Lower memory usage compared to Cranelift/LLVM.

Cons:

Slower runtime execution (code runs ~2–3× slower than Cranelift or LLVM).

Very limited optimizations.

Best for:

Fast startup / untrusted sandbox environments (IoT, blockchain smart contracts, edge cases with tight resource constraints).

2. Cranelift

Design goal: Balance between compilation speed and execution performance.

How it works:

JIT compiler designed specifically for WebAssembly (now part of the Bytecode Alliance).

Generates relatively optimized code, but compiles faster than LLVM.

Pros:

Much faster runtime than Singlepass (optimized register allocation, inlining, some vectorization).

Still relatively fast to compile, though slower than Singlepass.

Cons:

Not as fast or optimized as LLVM for long-running workloads.

Best for:

Serverless and edge workloads where you want better performance than Singlepass but still reasonable startup time.

3. LLVM

Design goal: Maximum runtime performance with deep optimizations.

How it works:

Uses LLVM as a backend, applying advanced compiler passes (vectorization, loop unrolling, interprocedural analysis, etc.).

Pros:

Fastest runtime execution (often close to native C performance).

Huge ecosystem of optimizations.

Cons:

Slowest compilation time (can be 10–50× slower than Singlepass).

Higher memory usage.

Best for:

Long-lived services and compute-heavy workloads where compilation overhead is amortized.

In Wasmer Edge (Wasmer’s managed compute platform):

Singlepass: used when you need near-instant cold starts and strict safety.

Cranelift: good middle ground, default in many cases.

LLVM: reserved for workloads where execution speed matters much more than startup latency.

✅ Summary:

Singlepass = fastest to compile, slowest to run.

Cranelift = balanced (good trade-off).

LLVM = slowest to compile, fastest to run.
